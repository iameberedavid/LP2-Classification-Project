TELCO CHURN ANALYSIS

## Business Understanding
In the fiercely competitive telecommunications industry, customers have the liberty to choose from a multitude of network providers, making customer retention a critical concern. Churn, the phenomenon of customers switching from one operator to another, poses significant challenges for telecom companies.

The annual churn rate in this industry typically ranges between 15% to 25%, highlighting the need to prioritize customer retention. To thrive in this competitive market, telecom companies recognize the strategic importance of retaining high-value customers. Therefore, the reduction of churn rate is a top business priority for these companies.

To effectively combat customer churn, telecom companies need accurate predictive models that can identify customers at high risk of churn. By analyzing customer-level data, such models can be developed and used to identify key indicators of churn.

The process of churn usually undergoes three phases:
The satisfaction phase: During this phase, customers generally exhibit contentment with the provided services and behave in line with their usual patterns.

The trigger phase: In this phase, customer experiences and satisfaction levels start to fluctuate. Triggers for churn can include enticing offers from competitors, unjust charges, deteriorating service quality, and other factors. Customer behavior during this phase often deviates from their satisfaction months. Identifying customers at a high risk of churn during this period is critical, as timely interventions can be implemented, such as matching competitors' offers or improving service quality. The prediction of the likelihood of churn using the best model is done in this phase.

The churn phase: This phase represents the point at which a customer officially seizes to patronize the company. Such customer is said to have churn. Most times, the churn customer would switch to a competitor company and might remain with them.

By comprehending the customer lifecycle and effectively identifying customers at risk of churn during the trigger phase, telecom companies can proactively implement targeted retention strategies. These strategies include efforts to match competitors' offerings, enhance service quality, and create personalized experiences. Such proactive measures hold the potential to bolster customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and cement long-lasting relationships with valuable customers.

Project Scenario
For this project, I am the Data Scientist of a prominent telecom firm called Vodafone Corporation. I will analyze the available customer-level data of the company and build eight (8) different machine learning models with the data. These models will be tuned for optimal performance and the best model can be used to predict the likelihood of churn. I will identify the key indicators of churn, and recommend solutions to help the company achieve a decline in churn rate, high customer satisfaction and increase in customer retention/longevity.

Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between the monthly charges and the churn of customers.
Alternate Hypothesis: There is a relationship between the monthly charges and the churn of customers.

Analytical Questions
1. What is the overall churn rate of the telecommunication company?
2. What is the average monthly charges to churn customers compared to non-churn customers?
3. What percentage of the top 100 most charged customers churned?
4. What percentage of the top 100 least charged customers churned?
5. What is the churn rate of male customers with partners, dependents and high monthly charges?
6. What is the churn rate of customers without online security?
7. What is the churn rate of customers without online backup?
8. What is the churn rate of customers without device protection?
9. What is the churn rate of customers without Tech support?
10. How does the absence of online security, online backup, device protection and Tech support add up to lead to churning?
11. How does the length of customers' contract affect their likelihood of churn?
12. How does the length of customers' tenure affect their likelihood of churn?

This project was done with the aid of the Jupyter Notebook in this repository and it bears all the codes and procedures used to achieve success. The datasets for this project were collected from different sources and were also saved in this repository. The entire analytical and modelling processes are well explained in my Medium publication: https://eberedavid.medium.com/telco-churn-analysis-d463035fcbb5
